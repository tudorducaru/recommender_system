But over the past few years there has been a new movement of young RVers who have intentionally chosen to live with less stuff, be mobile, and take their lives on the road. This podcast is for people who are interested in downsizing their life, creating remote income, and working from anywhere.<br />\\n<br />\\nThe RV Entrepreneur Podcast is a weekly show where I interview nomadic entrepreneurs <br />\\nwho have made the leap into the RV lifestyle and have taken their businesses with them on the road. My name is Heath Padgett and in 2014 I quit my job in software sales to go on a year long RV trip across America with my newlywed wife. After spending a year on the road and traveling to all 50 states, we realized that returning back to \\u201clife as normal\\u201d in a 9-5 job wasn\\u2019t going to fly. Instead, we spent 2015 building up a remote income through our online business and freelance video skills, paying off over $14k of student debt in the process. On this podcast, I'll share everything I learn about how to make money while traveling, based on my own experiences and full-time RVer guests. Unlike most business-related podcasts, the entrepreneurs who I bring on my show aren\\u2019t millionaires, just normal people who have created remote income streams that allow them to work from anywhere and travel the world. To email me or be a guest on my show, you can fill out this form at HeathPadgett.com/RVEpodcast.\",\"It's not only about the obvious journeys, the travels past 70 that make the most sense.

While independence offers a great deal of freedom and flexibility, it\\u2019s not for everyone. The series explores options available in an expanding industry landscape, offering comparisons between different types of independent models from Independent Broker Dealers (IBDs) to Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) and Hybrid RIAs. <br />\\n<br />\\nThe goal of this series is to dispel some myths, share some facts, and help advisors get better educated on the options available without any concern over confidentiality or obligation. Episodes also include conversations with industry leaders and breakaway advisors who left the employee world for one where they could grow their advisory business in ways they could not in the brokerage space.

Affect Autism is more cost effective because it works with parents who apply the strategies that Floortime offers, promoting playful interactions over behaviour management techniques.

And if I\\u2019m known for anything, it\\u2019s very lengthy blogs. Brevity is really not my style. <br />\\n<br />\\nI\\u2019m challenging myself to go shorter and the Measurement Minute is the ultimate test.

But I\\u2019m not going to ruthlessly limit myself to that. I love digital analytics. I often get ticked off by how hard enterprise transformation is. I do more than my share of dabbling in Machine Learning, and occasionally bubble up from work long enough to talk analytics in sports and even the wider-world.  <br />\\n<br />\\nNo rules.
